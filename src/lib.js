  Generate a new Sudoku puzzle with the desired number of cells filled in.

  The generator returns a puzzle as a UInt8Array that contains either the digit

  All digits in a new game are made into "given" cells that cannot be modified.
  Empty cells are "normal" and can be either filled in with a digit or given
  player-entered "notes" which help keep track of possible digits in a cell.

  A full solution is included in the array after the puzzle, starting at index 81.
